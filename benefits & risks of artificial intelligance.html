    <td> Increase work efficiency
AI-powered machines are great at doing a particular repetitive task with amazing efficiency. The simple reason is that they remove
 human errors from their tasks to achieve accurate results every time they do that specific task.
Moreover, such machines can work 24X7</td>
    <td>AI is Unsustainable
Intelligent machines have characteristically high computing powers contributed by an array of several processers.
 These computer chips have rare earth materials like Selenium as a major constituent. Besides, the batteries of such machines run on
 Lithium, again a rare element in earth’s crust. 
 The increased mining of these materials is irreversibly damaging our environment at a rapid pace.
 Moreover, they consume huge amounts of power to function,
 that is putting severe pressure on our power plants and again harming the environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Work with high accuracy
Scientists are working to teach artificial intelligence powered machines to solve complex equations and perform critical tasks 
on their own so that the results obtained have higher accuracy as compared to their human counterparts.</td>
    <td>Lesser Jobs
There is no doubt that machines do routine and repeatable tasks much better than humans. Many businesses would prefer machines 
instead of humans to increase their profitability, thus reducing the jobs that are available for the human workforce.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Reduce cost of training and operation
	 machines already reduce the cost of operations with their high efficiency and accuracy of doing work. 
	 For example, machines don’t take breaks and can perform the same mundane task again and again without any downtime 
	 or change in results.</td>
    <td>A threat to Humanity
Elon Musk is considered to be one of the smartest person working on AI in present times. He has also stated publicly 
that AI is the biggest threat to human civilization in the future.
 This means that the dystopian future that sci-fi movies show is not impossible. Also, Stephen Hawking has always shown
 his disagreement with the advancement in the field of AI.
The biggest risk associated with AI is that machines would gain sentience and turn against humans in case they go rogue.</td>
